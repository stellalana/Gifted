# Gifted

## Link to use the app:

This is a fun web app to pull sample GIFs from the Giphy API on a variety of topics. The user is supplied with a number of starting topics, but is allowed to enter new topics via the form if they would like to explore other types of gifs.

This project was for a homework assignment while I attended a full-stack web dev program at UNC and is currently completed with no further plans to update. But users can email the author (Stella Griffith) at stella.l.griffith@gmail.com with any questions.
